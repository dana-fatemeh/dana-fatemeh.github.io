# My Site Starter

A tiny, modern static site you can deploy anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, your own server).

## Quick Start

1) Edit `index.html` — replace text, links, and your name/email.
2) (Optional) Customize colors in `styles.css`.
3) Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.

### Deploy: GitHub Pages (free)
- Create a new repo on GitHub named `your-username.github.io`.
- Upload these three files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js` (and this README if you want).
- In repo settings → Pages, ensure the branch is set to `main` and root folder.
- Your site will be live at `https://your-username.github.io`.

### Custom Domain
- Buy a domain from a registrar (e.g., Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare).
- In your DNS, create a CNAME `www` pointing to `your-username.github.io`.
- In your repo, create a file named `CNAME` with just your domain in it (e.g., `www.example.com`).

### Alternative: Vercel / Netlify
- Create a free account and import your GitHub repo.
- One‑click deploy; add your custom domain in their dashboard.
